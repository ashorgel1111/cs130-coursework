        <p>Music has never been a straight path for me. However, after picking up the flute, my first instrument, for the first time in fourth grade,
           I knew that music would somehow be the rabbit hole I'd eventually decide to dive down. Subsequently beginning lessons in piano, teaching
           myself to play the organ through working as a church organist, and starting to fall in love with composition over the coming couple of
           years, all while setting my sights on an orchestral flute career, further solidified my immersion and devotion.
        </p>
        <p>But juggling all of this at a competent level is enough to make anyone crazy, especially for a perfectionist like me. After facing
           debilitating muscular problems in my face during my first year at Northwestern University as a flute performance major, I made the hardest
           but best decision in my musical life to leave my orchestral ambitions behind. Like a forest fire, this left a highly fertile environment
           for me to begin anew; this time, I plunged into something which light my flame even brighter: Early Music. After rehabilitating my embouchure
           muscles, I began working with numerous Chicago-based chamber groups as a Baroque flutist. Given more time to pursue keyboard studies, I
           set my sights on developing my skills as a continuo player, harpsichordist, and organist. This eventually led to a change in major to music
           theory.
        </p>
        <p>In 2019–2020, this all culminated in musical studies in Munich, Germany, with renowned harpsichordist Robert Schröter and a stipend to visit
           and record on numerous historical pipe organs in Central and North Germany from the 17th and 18th centuries. In March 2020, my residency in
           Germany was cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>2020–2021 has been a very productive time for my compositional and improvisational development. Commissioned to write a Baroque-style cantata,
           it has been a year of intense movement for me in historical music theory research and personal musicianship. With the challenges of the
           pandemic on the music industry, I turn my sights towards exploring opportunities in arts administration and project managment within music.
