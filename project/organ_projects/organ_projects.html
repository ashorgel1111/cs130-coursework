          <h1>Baroque Organ Research (Leipzig and Hamburg Regions, Germany)</h1>
          <p id='germany-first'>During early spring of 2020, I received a small stipend to research and visit historic organs from the seventeenth and
             eighteenth centuries in North Germany. My travels brought me to ten cities in four German states and allowed me
             to record and perform on highly influential instruments in the history of Western music.
          </p>
          <p>The following is a short sample of media (pictures, recordings, information) gathered from my visits to several of the cities.

              <p>Halle is located about 30 minutes from Leipzig by train and was the birthplace of composer George Frederick Handel.
                                 The Marktkirche (Market Church) holds a historic organ from the 1660s from which the young Handel was taught by his
                                 first keyboard and composition teacher Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow. The entire organ's mechanism and keyboard
                                 remains intact from the time of Handel's youth.<br>

        <h1>2020 Remote Christmas Concert (Buffalo, NY Region)</h1>
        <p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most churches in the winter of 2020 were closed, many cancelling their Christmas worship and
           music outright. This project enlisted the help of local churches in the region to put together a Christmas "collage"
           of organs and performers to feature various local venues. Shared with dozens of churches in the area, the music in this project
           was used by several churches in their own remote radio worship.
